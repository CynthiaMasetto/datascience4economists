# Datascience4economists

First of all, welcome to the repository of the class ECO-10506 Econometrics and Data Science.
We'll use this __hub__ for sharing code and some notes with you.

## What is Github?

GitHub is an online; browser based distributed [version control](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Version_control) system for software developers using the Git revision control system. The service provides free public repositories, issue tracking, graphs, code review, downloads, wikis and collaborator management. There are also social networking elements of the service including feeds and the ability to follow other users.

This repository is **constantly updated**, so we suggest visiting it at least once a week.

Before we start, you must already have a GitHub or GitHub Enterprise account. If you already have it, ignore this message, otherwise open it [here](https://github.com/join).

Here are some steps through the process of [signing up for GitHub](https://github.com/join).:
>S1: Go to Github sign in page. Then enter a username, valid email address, and password.Use at least one lowercase letter, one numeral, and seven characters.
>
>S2: We suggest to review the GitHub Terms of Service and Privacy Policy before continuing. Upon clicking the “Create an account” button you will simultaneously be agreeing to these documents.
>
>S3: Choose a plan. You have two choice: Free and paid, the paid version has private repositories with $7/month. For the purposes of the course, __the free version is enough__.
>
>S4: Tailor experience: Waste of time..., you can skip it and we concluded.

## Getting started :dizzy:

Though often used synonymously, its important to note that Git and GitHub are two different things. Git is a particular implementation of version control originally designed by [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) as a way of managing the Linux source code. Other systems of version control exist though they are used less frequently. Git can be used to refer both to a particular approach taken to version control and the software underlying it.

Given that difference, how are we going to interact in Github?. Typically, the interactions are given by committing/pulling/pushing/branching/actually working with the code from a repository. __In this course, interaction activities are limited to the use of *pulling* the repository.__ It is very, very useful to read the [github glossary](https://help.github.com/articles/github-glossary/) to assimilate the specific terms we use across our site and documentation. More details for pulling the repository are given in the next section.


## Installation

So, for pulling, we suggest to [install GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/), supported Microsoft Windows or OS X operating systems. More techincal information about Github Desktop can ben founded [here](https://services.github.com/on-demand/github-desktop/pull-request-github-desktop).

After you've created a Github account and install Github Desktop,the next step is to __clone it__ to your local environment.
Here we have a nice picture of how to clone our repository (in Github Desktop clearly) -> [Cloning](https://services.github.com/on-demand/images/gifs/github-desktop/clone-repository-locally.gif)

## Usage

As well described in the Syllabus, this course will make use of **Python 2.7 and R.**

### Download and Install R


#### Installing R:

Windows and Mac users most likely want one of these versions of R:

> [Linux](https://cran.itam.mx/bin/linux/)

> [OS X](https://cran.itam.mx/bin/macosx/)

> [Windows](https://cran.itam.mx/bin/windows/)

#### Installing Python 2.7:

Depending on you Operating System, choose some of this [versions](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2710/).

*__... and finally__*

#### Anaconda!!:

However, to ensure that everyone can use the packages in a friendly way, we suggest downloading Ananconda, which includes Python 2.7 (via Jupiter Notebook) as well as R (via R-Studio). Most of the files we will be sharing will be adapted for Anaconda.

So, to download Anaconda, you just to enter in [Anaconda Distribution] (https://www.continuum.io/downloads) ,choose you preferred plataform and download the Python 2.7 version.

Happy coding!!
